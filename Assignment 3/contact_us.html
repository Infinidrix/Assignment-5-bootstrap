                            <p>Socrates put it best when he said, “Education is not filling a vessel but kindling a flame.” Education shouldn’t be a burden but a passion as wild and free as any other. Free to choose which course to take and free to forge a new one if need be. Education that is directed by the interest of the student. And of course, education should be challenging otherwise it would lose its thrill. The trill of finding out a math formula before the teacher can pen it down on the blackboard, the thrill of finding out the underlying connections and intricacies in physics, the thrill of discovering your passions where others wouldn’t, and the trill of finding out that you’re not alone in your passions.</p>

                            <br><p>The more I read, the more I realized I wasn't reading about a hero. I wasn't reading about a tragedy. I wasn't reading at all. I was writing myself in the pages of my imagination.</p>
