                    <p>
                        And just like that, the most important event of my life had passed. On this random lazy Sunday afternoon, I just finished asking my Question. As long as history can remember, when a man or woman reaches their 22nd birthday, a mysterious entity grants them the ability to ask one question which will be answered instantly and fully. What was this mysterious entity? Why did it care to answer questions? Why at 22 years old? Well no one was curious enough to waste their one precious question on it. Instead they’d either ask their Question or choose to delay to another day, one when they’d know what to ask. I was one of those who chose to keep my Question until today when I decided to trade it for an answer on this hill.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I began to slowly descend down back to the city. It wasn’t necessary to go up a hill to ask the Question, but we were told at school that the journey shows us the weight of our Questions. “At the top of the hills, look down upon the city and then go down only to show it a better way.” Those were the exact words our teacher, Mrs. Podluck, said to us. Our Questions were our contributions to society; each of us born with the innate ability to impact the world. As per tradition, that when we die, our Question is to be written on the top of our gravestones, followed by the other achievements of our lives. People who were ashamed to tell their Questions had a question mark on top of their gravestones, as if questioning their legacy. We were taught that Questions were the one place where people were truly equal. The spoiled rich teenagers, who are used to getting as much and as many as they want, would be humbled when not only do they get one but their only Question is decided mostly by the parents who want to boast of how sophisticated their children are and to gain a business advantage over their competitors. The poor, on the other hand, get their turn on the spotlight finally able to be worthy of history. It gave worth to each individual person, a worth that each person gets to assign a value.

                        Mrs. Podluck’s Question was the cure for a rare disease afflicting her 5 year old son, a Question asked at age 35. Our young brains were not capable of deciding for ourselves whether this was a selfish Question or a selfless one (mind you, the disease was extremely rare and her cure was used on 2 other people). For us, that was a noble Question and this was a simple world. Of course, the liberty to ask our Questions is a luxury not all can afford. Just in the neighboring city, around 3 miles east, it was decided that Questions belonged to the society. On someone’s 22nd birthday, they will be assigned a Question to ask, a Question that their government decided was most beneficial to the society. If they ask a different Question, they would be promptly flogged at the town square and sentenced to a life in prison. Tyranny, we were told it was, a loss of individuality and the death of the pursuit of happiness. Even though we scorn their system ruthlessly, we don’t hesitate to beg them for food every time a major drought hits, oftentimes selling our under-22 children as slaves. Our naïve notions of just and selfish were abandoned soon enough.

                        Nearing the city, I could feel the stares of the city folk from a distance. Their eyes shooting daggers at me, while they tell whomever is nearby, “Look at this foolish woman, she just wasted her wish.” To which another person would reply “Ahhh it runs in her family. She can’t help it!” And they wouldn’t be wrong.  I was an only child to my parents. My father’s Question had been on how to win over his first wife, and by the time he’d married my mother, he was a drunken mess. My mother, on the other hand, was an idealist at heart. Her Question was on how she can help people from the neighboring city escape prison. The answer required resources she didn’t have and she was refused by the city council and every wealthy person. Whether she asked this for service to humanity or for a specific beloved, she had never answered but people in my village always say that she’s never looked happy since. After I had endured their horrible excuse of a marriage, I soon slipped into my own. He was a calm, gentle soul utterly unlike my dad. He had volunteered his Question, allowing the government to assign a Question to him. I, in my naïvety, mistook that for generosity and gladly wed him. It wasn’t that he was mean or harsh, it was that he didn’t care enough to be any of that. It soon turned out that he was a husk of a man, empty, dull and featureless beyond salvation. A deadweight burden I had chosen to shoulder. He had no dreams, surprising given how much he sleeps. I was forced to be the sole breadwinner for the family, even through and after my pregnancy. He was stuck by a mysterious illness on a Saturday. No not yesterday, a Saturday long ago began a sickness that took his life. Needless to say, ‘his’ Question was the only thing on his gravestone. Walking lost in thought, I stumbled on a rock, falling squarely on my arms.

                        A pair of hands hurried to my aid picking me up and dusting off my clothes. I blinked through my tears and looked up at a familiar face. “Should’ve asked for the safest route home, these streets are dangerous.” He said with a bright smile. His Question was of a curious sort. On the morning of his 22nd birthday, he had run to the nearest hill and asked for the most exciting hiking routes near and far. He then spent the remainder of his youth on the wildest adventures only coming back to rest and gather his strength. He returned with a wife on one of those adventures claiming that he “liked the view.” Now at age 40, he spends his time happily toiling hard to pay his many debts and spending his free time telling stories to wide eyed children and helping clumsy ladies. “May be I did ask that and I’m just a bad listener?" I replied. He laughed loudly and heartily before inviting me for tea with his wife. I politely declined saying that my daughter was all alone at home and continued on my way. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fact that I had just asked my Question hit me like a ton of bricks as soon as my house came into sight. Had my daughter packed her bags expecting me to tell her to leave his shabby house to live in a mansion? That I had brought down the tree of knowledge in one swoop.  I tried not to think about that, lest I should fear to enter my own home. What did I ask? Wait, what was the bloody Question? I stood still in the middle of the road. It took me a full 5 seconds to remember. Ahhhhhh yes, yes that was the Question. It wouldn’t win the award for best Question asked but it was a memorable legacy. Regaining my composure, I continued to walk home, stopping at the door to take a long breath, then I stepped in. Inside stood three people, my daughter and two heartbroken, clueless doctors.
