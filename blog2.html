                    <p>Rule #1 of time travel, don't look at the clock. Jim looked at the clock. It was 8:45, a perfect time to get to the office. It was as late as he could be without drawing attention to himself. Jim got to his desk and looked around while the office desktop started. “Hey”s and “Good morning”s were tossed around then he sat down and faced the computer. His work on one monitor and the cat videos that make work bearable on the other. Today’s task was the monotonous grind he’s come to expect. A singular task for one client after the other with only the slightest differences. He vaguely remembers it being interesting when he first started working. “How’s the spec coming along?” That was Lilith, his boss. “It needs some polish before we send it for the client for review.” As he was saying that a cat was doing a backflip, while a dog looked very confused, on his monitor. His boss appreciated how hard it is to find new talented people willing to work a dead end job, so she didn’t reprimand him. “Good, tell Jude when you’re done. I want this client to go through her, he’s the arrogant type with a soft spot for a pretty lady with some fine assets.” This would’ve raised plenty of eyebrows with HR, sitting right in front of him, if they weren’t busy playing solitaire.</p>
                    <p>The day was going as every day did, when a pleasant distraction arrived. An ad popped up on his cat video monitor saying “Register for Time Travel now!” It sounded like a virus, he clicked it. Other times he had to go out of his way to install slightly annoying viruses to get a break while an ill-competent IT staff fumbled around and this was begging for it. A form showed up, and he filled it with the speed of someone whose personal info was crafted for the digital age. And so qwerty123 registered to what the website called a “new start anytime.” Go somewhere no one will see you and say a very long word with a time, a short while in the past, in mind, then you’ll time travel. He said the word. It had a nice feel to it phonetically speaking. The only other thing on the site was a clumsy h1 tag with a text reading:</p>
                    <p>Rule #1 of time travel, don't look at the clock.</p>
                    <p>Maybe they’d like us to redesign the site, he thought with a chuckle. The thought made him realize he’s still at the office, clock striking 2. He grimly went back to work.</p>
                    <p>The 3:45 came around, bringing with it more reasons to slack off. Most people had assumed their relaxed about-to-go-home phase. Banter was plenty and everyone had something to vent about. Jim just finished his work and nervously called Jude over. This could be done over email but why waste an opportunity like this, he thought as he half mumbled through the feature set and what she should tell the client. A couple of self-deprecating jokes had a hard time finding their way to her and fell flat. “Uhhh haha yeah, tell me what the client says, okay… hehe, see you around.” She turned and slowly walked away to her desk, Jim’s eyes lingering on her with his thoughts painted bright on his face. The faint tune of a solitaire victory chimed in the office moments later.</p>
                    <p>Now he was playing a game. It was 9:00 in the evening. He didn’t know how he got there or if he ate dinner, but he knew that it didn’t bother him much. Not much exciting things happen anyway. I don’t know what day of the week it is, he thought faintly. An improvised version of his favorite song filled his two-room apartment and soon enough turned into random mumblings. He walked to the kitchen, bathroom and storage room and peed while singing randomly and half-asleep. He turned around and walked straight into a white door.</p>
                    <p>I don’t have a white door, he thought reeling from the pain. He looked up at the door, then around the room. His heart skipped a beat. He opened the door and his heart skipped another beat. He found himself in a bathroom that only served the purpose of a bathroom. But more importantly, the bathroom he was currently in felt familiar. And much more importantly, it was bright outside, like daylight bright. He reached for his phone and almost opened it before he froze. That website that was it. He had time travelled. He was too scared to see or ask for the time but by looking around the office he could guess it is was 1:10 lunch time where he remembers leaving to go to the bathroom before going for lunch. Everything was going like it did last morning or this morning. His mind was doing heavy gymnastics trying to restructure its concept of time. It didn’t take it long, before he knew it, he was trying out different experiments and fervently avoiding the clock. The only difference he noted was that the ad didn’t come on at all this time. All else went the exact same way. He ate instant noodles with a touch of his own spices for dinner and giggled mindlessly at what he would do tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>He woke up in the morning to his alarm clock and he lazily picked it up and turned it off. He noticed it was half past seven. Suddenly the events of yesterday came crashing down on him. He felt his heart being tugged down to abyss and his lungs screaming for air. He had forgotten about rule 1 and it was just the first day. Nothing happened, and then nothing continued to happen. Everything was still for a long moment until his mind spoke up, “Maybe the rule is only for when you’re reliving the past.” As long as he wasn’t back in the past, the clock rule didn’t hold. It made sense in its own twisted way. He dressed with a smile and went over to work.</p>
                    <p>He got to work at 8:31. To a casual onlooker, it’d seem that Jim is just having a normal day, wasting away in a soul-sucking job. But he was lost in a train of thought. It was too risky to time travel during the day, since a simple forgetful glance or a coworker eager to announce the time will bring wrath unknown. He’d do it in the evening. Hours upon hours of gaming or perhaps he’d finally start that online course he never had the time for in the… “Hey, they loved it. Congratulations!” It was Jude. He took a moment to find his way to real life, smiled and said, “Great! I would hate to go back and do it again. Well that clears my plate for the day, what’s keeping you busy?” “Oh nothing much, I have to stay around for a call from a client and that’s all.” “I have just the right video to keep you company; what’s your stance on marble racing tournaments?” “Love them, Clementin is my roll model.” She said with a sly smile.</p>
                    <p>The rest of the day was uneventful but that didn’t keep Jim from grinning like an idiot through it. He went home in the afternoon and started an alarm for 6 hours later. He gamed until the alarm shouted then said the weird word and he found himself minutes after he had set the alarm. He played a different game and watched a bunch of episodes until the alarm rang. He wanted a final 6 hours but he didn’t know what he’d do with it so he slept. First thing next morning he signed himself up for an online course and went to work. Before he knew it, he was working away with a content smile that made his boss suspect him of embezzlement. He’d take frequent breaks finding reasons to go over to Jude’s desk and start up a conversation, growing more confident as he saw her warming up to him. His first evening with the course felt like reopening a secluded part of his mind, he had long forgotten about.</p>
                    <p>The next day came and went, leaving its mark of progress on Jim’s coursework. With each passing day, he got more involved with office banter, sometimes even managing to get a disinterested smile from HR. The course became a track and, in 6 months’ time, the track became an online degree. His nighttime studies were his lifeline, making the gaming a blur and the sleep a blink. He couldn’t believe himself as he typed out his resume and sent it out for several job openings. It was only a matter of time until a couple of them invited him for an interview and one accepted him.</p>
                    <p>He had his resignation letter where it needed to be and he walking around the office a last time. There were no ceremony for his departure, not even a hint of it. This didn’t bother Jim, actually this made it easier to do what he was meaning to do that day. “Hey, want to grab lunch sometime?” Their friendly banter had long been established and he was waiting for the right moment to ask her out.</p>
                    <p>“Can’t do today, tons of work today. What’s the occasion?”</p>
                    <p>“Anytime can do really and the occasion is I want to ask you out on a date.”</p>
                    <p>“Date sounds fancy, what do you mean?” It was obvious she didn’t expect this at all and didn’t know where to go with it.</p>
                    <p>“Ohh just a simple lunch somewhere, don’t get your hopes up. I’ve always had a crush on you for forever, just didn’t ask you out till now cus I didn’t want HR flipping out.”</p>
                    <p>“Wait we have HR here?”</p>
                    <p>“Yeah they’re the ones over there at… never mind that, what say you to a date?”</p>
                    <p>It was crushing. The rejection weighed like a ton of bricks on his heart as he walked over to his desk. “Didn’t think of you like that” Those were her words. He’d been infatuated with her since she joined a year ago. Maybe he’d come on a bit too strong, too awkward. Perhaps a lighter tone would’ve spared him the burn and saved the friendship from discomfort. He had to do it differently, no he wouldn’t lie about his feelings but he had to salvage the friendship.</p>
                    <p>“No worries, thanks for being honest and you can’t apologize for not feeling what I felt. Let’s spare ourselves the awkwardness and keep on being friends, nothing romantic.” The conversation went on after this and onto much tamer topics. They left the conversation on a good note and a promise to keep in touch. He checked the time. It was 11:45 in the morning, still plenty of time till his first afternoon at his new job. He left and wandered around the city, thinking about how one magic word turned his life around, a word he couldn’t remember anymore.</p>
